# Overview

Style is a simple & practical CSS preprocessor. You write your styles in our custom syntax, and then our compile magically transforms it into highly optimized CSS that can run anywhere.

 > **Style is still under construction, but we'll have a finished library soon. Until then, feel free to star us on [GitHub](https://github.com/aarvinr/style) or help contribute.**
